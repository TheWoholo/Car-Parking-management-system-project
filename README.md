# Car-Parking-management-system-project

## Abstract:
With the growing issues of urbanization and limited parking resources, developing a user-friendly Parking Management System is critical. This project provides a comprehensive system that combines parking slot occupancy detection and real-time slot availability display, with the user experience and parking facility efficiency as the top priorities. This method aims to address frequent urban difficulties such as traffic congestion and long parking search periods, which cause annoyance among vehicle owners. By utilizing modern occupancy sensors, central control units, and digital displays, we hope to simplify the parking experience. It detects car presence reliably, updates real-time slot availability, and communicates this information to users, minimizing the time and effort required to find a parking spot. Our unique contribution is the seamless integration of these components, which improves customer pleasure while optimizing space utilization. The system keeps track of entry and exit times, which can be utilized for security and auditing. Furthermore, the obtained data can guide future improvements and data-driven decision-making.

Our Parking Management System, by focusing on improving user experience and facility management, provides a realistic answer to the issues faced by urban parking, ultimately leading to more efficient and user-centric urban transportation solutions.

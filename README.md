# Car-Parking-management-system-project

## Idea: 
To build an automated digital parking management system with the help of 
logic gates

## Abstract:
  With the growing issues of urbanisation and limited parking resources, the development of a user-friendly Parking Management System is critical. This project provides a comprehensive system that combines parking slot occupancy detection and real-time slot availability display, with the user experience and parking facility efficiency as the top priorities.The goal behind this method is to address frequent urban difficulties such as traffic congestion and long parking search periods, which cause annoyance among vehicle owners. By utilising modern occupancy sensors, central control units, and digital displays, we hope to simplify the parking experience. It detects car presence reliably, updates real-time slot availability, and communicates this information to users, minimising the time and effort required to find a parking spot.Our unique contribution is the seamless integration of these components, which improves customer pleasure while optimising space utilisation. The system keeps track of entry and exit times, which can be utilised for security 
and auditing. Furthermore, the obtained data can be used to guide future improvements and data-driven decision-making. Our Parking Management System, by focusing on improving user experience and facility management, provides a realistic answer to the issues faced by urban parking, ultimately leading to more efficient and user-centric urban transportation solutions.
